I. About the dataset
The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository, and it is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

The dataset is consisted of 45,211 customer data on direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution, with variables below:

Client: age, job, marital, education, default status, housing, and loan
Campaign: last contact type, last contact month of year, last contact day of the week, and last contact duration
Others: number of contacts performed in current campaign, number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted, number of contacts performed before this campaign, outcome of previous campaign, and whether a client has subscribed a term deposit.
The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe (1/0) to a term deposit (variable y).
